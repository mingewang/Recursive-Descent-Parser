This program is Lab3b - Recurssive Decent Parser
PLease use the grammar to see what each function will do.
The first error message with a terminal is the rule that failed. 
The complete statements are held in m_rules, but are not printed out to screen. 
The lab writeup wasnt clear but a simple print function would fix this.



Files to grade - Parser.h and Parser.cpp
